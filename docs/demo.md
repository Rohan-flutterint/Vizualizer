# Vizualizer Demo Video Plan

## Goal

Demonstrate the end-to-end workflow: loading Excel, exploring schema, building a visualization via shelves, applying a filter, and saving a `.viz` project.

## Suggested Recording Steps

1. Launch Vizualizer.
2. Create an Excel workbook from the CSVs in `examples/` (open and save as `.xlsx`), then click **Open Excel** and select it.
3. Show the detected schema in the Fields panel.
4. Add `Region` to **Rows** and `Sales` to **Columns**.
5. Switch to **Bar** chart and show the rendered bars.
6. Add `Category` to **Rows** to show grouped bars.
7. Switch to **Line** and **Scatter** charts to show interactive plotting.
8. Save the project state as a `.viz` JSON file.

## Output

Record the demo in a short MP4 (30–60 seconds) and store it alongside this document when ready to publish.
